    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Waffles are a type of batter-based food made by pouring batter onto a hot
      griddle or waffle iron with a pattern of small, deep pockets. The batter
      is then cooked until it is set and the pockets are filled with steam.
      Waffles are often served for breakfast or brunch, and can be topped with a
      variety of items, such as butter, syrup, fruit, whipped cream, and
      powdered sugar.

    <p>
      Waffles are believed to have originated in Belgium in the 17th century.
      They were originally made with a yeast-leavened batter, but today most
      waffles are made with a batter that is leavened with baking powder or
      baking soda. Waffles can be made with a variety of different ingredients,
      including flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, and vanilla extract.
